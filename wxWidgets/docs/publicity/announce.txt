June 6, 2025 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce the first new
development release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.3.0 is the first release in the new 3.3.x development series and is
available now from

    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

Compared to the stable 3.0.x series, this version brings too many
improvements and even more bug fixes to list all of them here, please
see the change log

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.3.0/docs/changes.txt

for the list of the most important ones and here is the maximally condensed
summary of the major changes compared to 3.2:

- Support for dark mode in wxMSW under Windows 10 and later.
- New Chrome-based wxWebView backend and many other wxWebView improvements.
- Many improvements to wxAUI, including support for pinned and multiline tabs.
- Support for WebP format in wxImage.
- Support for high DPI cursors and animations.
- Latest versions of 3rd party libraries.
- Support for latest compilers (gcc 15, clang 19/Xcode 16) and C++ standards.


This release is the start of a new "development" release series, but these
development releases are suitable for production use: the only difference
between them and "stable" releases is that neither ABI nor API stability is
guaranteed in 3.3.x. However we strive to minimize API-incompatible changes
even so and, in spite of a huge number of changes in it, this release remains
almost fully API-compatible with wxWidgets 3.2 and updating the existing
applications to use it should be straightforward. However please make sure to
read the "INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES" section in the change log to be aware of the
breaking changes in it.


We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
