    <h1>UnityHubNative</h1>
    <p>
        UnityHubNative is a lightweight C++ / wxWidgets alternative to the unnecessarily heavy official Unity Hub, built
        using wxWidgets.
        It uses native widgets on all platforms instead of heavy web components like the official Electron hub.
    </p>
    <p>
        UnityHubNative launches many times faster, uses far less memory and CPU, and is a fraction of the total size of
        the official Unity Hub.
