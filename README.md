# Unity Hub Native

UnityHubNative is a lightweight C++ / wxWidgets alternative to the unnecessarily heavy official Unity Hub, built using [wxWidgets](https://wxwidgets.org/). This means that, instead of using heavy web components like the official Electron hub, it uses native GUI components on all platforms.

It launches many times faster, uses far less memory and CPU, and is a fraction of the total size of the offical Unity Hub.

> Supports Mac dark mode!
